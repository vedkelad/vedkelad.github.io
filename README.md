# PS2RecoilJS

Recoil pattern of guns in [PlanetSide 2](http://planetside2.com).


The actual recoil calculation part of this project is almost entirely a
translation of [PS2-Recoil](https://github.com/Kalyan12/PS2-Recoil) by
[Kalyan1](https://reddit.com/u/Kalyan1) which renders the recoil pattern of
GD-7F gun in [PlanetSide 2](https://planetside2.com) using Matlab.
